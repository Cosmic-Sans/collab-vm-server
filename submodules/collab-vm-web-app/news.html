      <center>Good evening everyone. You may have noticed on the Navbar there is a new option called "Themes". Yes, it's true. Starting<br>today, collab-vm officially supports a multitude of themes. This includes the classic theme, a dark theme, a XP-like theme, and a few others. <br>We hope you enjoy and in the future we will probably add an option to customize your own. Enjoy it!
